# Video Search using Natural Language

In this research, we propose a framework for searching long untrimmed videos for segments that logically correlate with a natural language query. We develop a new method that exploits state-of-the-art deep learning models on the temporal-action-proposal task and dense captioning of events in videos to be able to retrieve video segments that corresponds to an input query.
